# Data Sources
(1) [Electricity Transformer Datasets](https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/ETDataset)

(2) [Weather dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ohGYWWohJlOlb2gsGTeEq3Wii2egnEPR) from [AAAI paper "Informer"](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ohGYWWohJlOlb2gsGTeEq3Wii2egnEPR)

## Plan

(1) Estimate univariate time series of the two datasets and run arima.sim for simulations.
(2) Benchmark CoST against some traditional time series models and some other deep learning frameworks for univariate data.
